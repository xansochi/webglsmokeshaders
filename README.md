This is a simple example how to use shaders with WebGL.

WebGL is a JavaScript application programmer interface (API) that allows a programmer to use the graphics processing unit (GPU) of a computing device in a web browser window to render real-time 3D computer graphics.

WebGL require a shader program for the vertex and fragment manipulation sections of the graphics pipeline. A shader program are written in GLSL (Graphics Library Shader Language). This section provides a general introduction to GLSL.
